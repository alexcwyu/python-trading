31-Oct-2017:
- Fix the subscription when multiple instruments
13-Nov-2017:
- In instrument data manager, on_bar, the provider id will depends on app context's application type (backtest / live trading),
 instead of bar's source provider id. In the coming version, the BackTesting as provider_id series/frame will be deleted and
 not serialized.
7-Dec-2017:
- Rollback all 13-Nov-2017's changes. Now a new flag is introduced for series and dataframe as transient. When it is transient,
it will never be serialized and stored to the database. It is particular useful when we replay those historical market data
in backtesting, so we will use a transient series to store it during backtest.
